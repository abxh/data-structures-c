# stack

`stack` is an implementation of a stack using a linked list. `stack_helpers.h`
can be used to convert between stack nodes and values. This version is
written as proof-of-concept and/or more readable version of a stack.

`astack` is an alternate implementation of a stack using an array. The
array has a fixed size, but can be manually resized. This is the more
performant version of the two and should be preferred.
