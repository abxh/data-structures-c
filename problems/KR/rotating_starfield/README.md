# rotating_star_field

This problem is puts some icing on the cake on the problem of bitwise rotation posed in K & R chapter 2.

> **note**: my solution has linux-specific elements.

**Problem:**

Generate a sparse bit pattern of 1's and 0's of size `size_t´x`size_t`, and rotate the bit patterns left to right or
right to left as time passes.

Continously print the bit pattern using ' ' to represent 0 and ´*´ to represent 1.
