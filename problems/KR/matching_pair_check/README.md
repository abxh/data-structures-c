# matching_pair_check

This is a problem based on K & R chapter 1 with some tweaks.

**Problem:**

For a given input, check if there are any unbalanced parentheses, brackets and curly braces. Also check
for single, double and back quotes. And finally check for the C symbol pair `/*` and `*/`.

Every starting symbol must end with a corresponding ending symbol. For example, `(` must end with `)`.
