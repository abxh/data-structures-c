# matching_pair_check

This is a problem based on K & R chapter 1 exercise 24 with some tweaks.

**Problem:**

For a given input, check if there are any unbalanced parentheses, brackets and curly braces. Also check
for single, double and back quotes. And finally check for the C comment symbol pair `/*` and `*/`.

Every starting symbol cannot end with the wrong corresponding ending symbol between which there can
be zero or more character in between that can include correctly written pairs.
