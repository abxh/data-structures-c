This problem is puts some icing on the cake on the problem of bitwise rotation posed in K & R chapter 2.

> **note**: my solution has linux-specific elements.

**Problem:**

Generate a "sparse" random bit pattern of 1's and 0's of size 64x8, and rotate the bit patterns left to right or
right to left as time passes. It is "sparse" in the sense that there are less 1's than 0's.

Continously print each row of the bit pattern using ' ' to represent 0 and ´*´ to represent 1.
