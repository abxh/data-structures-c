# Calculator

The problem is based on the kattis problem "Calculator" described [here](https://open.kattis.com/problems/calculator).

## Extra challenges:
- Store and allow the last evaluated value to be used with `_`.
- Parse floating numbers as inputs.
- Assume every operator is left-associative, and implement a power operator with `^`.
- Permit implicit multiplication between number and parenthesised terms and between two parenthesised terms.
